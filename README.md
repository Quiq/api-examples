# api-examples
A collection of examples showcasing how you can use the Quiq Public API.

The API is fully documented at https://developers.goquiq.com/api/docs

## Sample usage

```
python ./get_queue_info.py -u [Insert user identity here] -s [Insert secret here] -d api-demo.goquiq.com -q default
```

Note that the user identity and secret are not your username and password. They
tokens created by Quiq for API access.
